# Feedreader

## About the test
This test ensures that the elements in HTML, CSS and JavaScript function or are formatted correctly. Any modifications to the code need to follow the testing guideline or else the test returns errors.   

## Instruction to run the test
First, use the command **cd** to enter to the desired location for the project. Using this command to clone the project (you can use either HTTPS or SSH to clone):

    $ git clone https://github.com/lucasbui92/Feedreader.git
Or

    $ git clone git@github.com:lucasbui92/Feedreader.git
Find the location of the project and click **index.html** to load the page.

## How the testing works
When the programmer tries to modify the code in HTML, CSS or JavaScript, they need to ensure that any modifications follow the guideline of the feedreader test so that each criteria passes successfully without any errors. 

If an error appears, it will show what criteria fails by displaying "Expect **X** to be(equal) to **something**. The **X** is the result produced by your program while **something** is the expected result. The **X** behaves like the output produced when you have "console.log" in your code that you want to see what the output looks like.
